Thus,The the the this is a more challenging task for future investigation that arises
from Chapter 7. On the other hand, here the periodic jitter at a single 
frequency was considered. But in practice, the ToF cameras may have periodic 
jitter at multiple frequencies. Then, it is very interesting to know how
the analytical model will change accordingly. Will the influence be linear or
non linear and will it be partially or fully cancel on range measurements? So,
some interesting questions arise from this future investigation.
A finite number of evaluations of the Monte Carlo simulation were used to
investigate the influence of random jitter on range measurements in Chapter 8. 
With increasing the number of simulations, it is surprisingly effective to estimate
the better result than the current one. In order to understand the
impact of uncertainty of the results obtained, it is necessary to analyse the
stochastic model for the full range of possible outcomes, to get much more
accurate results. On the other hand, all simulations were done at fixed integration
period T = 1 ms and it is interesting to investigate the behaviour of the
random jitter for various T, especially for less than 1 ms integration period
since now the depth sensor manufacturers are trying to develop the AMCW
ToF cameras with short integration periods.
